## Understanding the problem

This error message, "Minified React error #418", indicates a hydration mismatch. Hydration is the process where React takes the server-rendered HTML and attaches the client-side JavaScript. This error occurs when the HTML rendered on the server doesn't match what React expects on the client. The specific error message "Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client." linked in the error text clarifies this [1].

## How to verify

1. **Inspect the HTML source:** View the source code of the page (usually by right-clicking and selecting "View page source" or "Inspect" and going to the "Elements" tab).
2. **Compare server HTML with client rendering:** Examine the HTML structure and content. Look for differences between what you see in the source and what is rendered in the browser after the page loads. This could be missing or extra elements, different attributes, or variations in content.
3. **Check for conditional rendering:** If your code renders different content based on client-side conditions (like browser features, user preferences, or data loaded after the initial render), this can cause a mismatch.

## Suggested fix

The most common cause of hydration mismatches is rendering different content on the server and client. To fix this, ensure that the initial render produces the same HTML structure and content regardless of whether it's server-rendered or client-rendered.

Here are a few common scenarios and their fixes:

*   **Using client-side only APIs or data during server rendering:** Avoid using browser-specific APIs (`window`, `localStorage`, etc.) or fetching data that's only available on the client during the initial render cycle.
*   **Conditional rendering based on client-side state:** If you need to render different content based on client-side state, use a state variable and render the element conditionally after the component has mounted on the client.
