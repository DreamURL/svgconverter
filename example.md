why did you build this? What's new and unigue about your launch compared to alternatives? what are you most proud of in this launch?


  🎨 Why I built this SVG Converter:

  After years of struggling with expensive design tools and complicated conversion processes, I realized there was a huge gap in the market for a truly free, professional-grade SVG converter. Most alternatives either charge
  hefty subscription fees, add watermarks, or require registration just to convert a simple image.

  ✨ What makes this unique:

  Unlike other converters that just trace images, our tool generates clean, optimized SVG code that developers
  actually want to use. It exports directly as React components, CSS, or pure SVG - saving hours of manual coding.
  Plus, it's 100% free with unlimited conversions and no strings attached.

  🚀 What I'm most proud of:

  The instant conversion speed and code quality. We've managed to create a tool that rivals expensive software like
   Adobe Illustrator for basic conversions, but runs entirely in your browser. The fact that web developers and
  designers can go from image to production-ready code in seconds - that's what gets me excited about this launch!
